How To Survive CS@WPI is a website full of resources that might be helpul for Computer Science students at WPI. This website is full of information that have been gathered from both our time studying here, but also suggestions from other WPI students. It contains a number of resources and the ability for people to submit their own.
This website uses Svelte for implementation making the front-end and back-end connect in a way useful for both developers.
The front end uses Bulma to create the sleek look as well as the built in components for the content cards and form submission. The backend uses NPM express, rollup, svelte.
To best use this, access each page via direct link. The NavBar has been causing issues when we began hosting.

This project was hard in trying to create the front end layout. Lots of time was spent trying to layout information then swtich it from HTML to Svelte. There were some issues making Bulma work with Svelte to begin with and a small stylistic element had to be cut to ensure proper implementation. Glitch is not super Svelte friendly, so functionality that may work locally was removed to ensure the pages would load when hosted on Glitch.
A back end struggle that was faced, was trying to combine webpack with svelte. There was not much documentation on this insight and almost was functioning accidentally. When it came time to be more specific and concise with what parts of svelte was used and what not, webpack became unusable. Hence, we used rollup instead.
Chayanne created the front end elements using Bulma in HTML, before switching to Svelte, and supplied content for the website.
Hailey worked on the back-end. This composed of making sure all technologies worked together, downloading all needed files and templating svelte files and implementing the rollup bund. Aditionally, she helped supply website content.
