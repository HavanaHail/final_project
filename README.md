  How To Survive CS@WPI is a website full of resources that might be helpul for Computer Science students at WPI. This website is full of information that have been gathered from both our time studying here, but also suggestions from other WPI students. It contains a number of resources and the ability for people to submit their own. 
  This website uses Svelte for implementation making the front-end and back-end connect in a way useful for both developers. 
  The front end uses Bulma to create the sleek look as well as the built in components for the content cards and form submission.
  
  This project was hard in trying to create the front end layout. Lots of time was spent trying to layout information then swtich it from HTML to Svelte. There were some issues making Bulma work with Svelte to begin with and a small stylistic element had to be cut to ensure proper implementation. 
  (insert info about backend struggles)
  Chayanne created the front end elements and supplied content. 
  Hailey worked on the back end elements and helped supply website content.
